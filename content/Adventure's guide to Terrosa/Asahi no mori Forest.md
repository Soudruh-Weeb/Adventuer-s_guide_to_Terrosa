Through out the world there are many weird places. The magical [[Lindohold Forest]] Forest inhabited by all sorts of mystical creature and elves or The mysterious [[Everdeep]] in which hides all the worst thing beyond imagination. However nothing is more stranger then the Asahi on mori Forest or as the inhabitants and locals call it simply Asahi no mori. While no one knows why is it called that way the translation of the name means "the forest of the Sunlight/morning". 

Aside of the pink leafed trees the forest seems almost normal, however one entered many people felt weird feeling. This feeling is more notable by people of high magical potential or strong religious connection. This phenomenon is still being researched by schooler around the kingdom and many speculate that the forest servers as a portal to a different plane of existence. This theory is also supported by the fact that going through the forest takes way more that is should. However it some say that it might be cause by some outer forces toying with ones perception of time.

As for what lives inside the forest, it still remains mostly unknown as many people who ventured into it never returned or returned with no recollection of what they saw inside. 
Those who returned claim that the wild life is almost no different to ours as you can find dears, boars and other forest creatures with one major difference. That being their out of the word color of hide being apparently more brightly colored making them perfectly camouflaged in their environment. 

On related note there have been reported sightings of foxes with multiple tails a small number saying the even saw them standing on their back legs and acting almost human like. However no evidence was presented to support these claims.
