Through out the kingdom many speak of an underground organization called "Thieves' guild" or "Dark guild". Apparently it run all of the black markets and assassination services in the kingdom. Many claim they have been targeted by members of this guild, while searching for evidence of its existence, but just as many people say that: "if such thing existed the authorities would lunch a large scale shakedown in order to bring it down", but in my opinion it is a question of how much they pay to keep it from getting to the high command. I myself have tried search for any clues in order to enhance this book but only thing I found it a weird symbol which seems to be related but I have a feeling I should stop here for the safety of my life.
