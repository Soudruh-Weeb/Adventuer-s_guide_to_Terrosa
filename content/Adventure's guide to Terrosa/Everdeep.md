 "Everdeep? Ay been in there few time. It is totally nuts down there. Fishes flying through the air, giant rats wait for opportunity to take your head in one bite. And creatures beyond ones imaginations. Mi granny always scared me by telling me rumors about witches that will take me away if I misbehave or that a great pumpkin will come to eat me if I don't eat my vegetables, but down there...oh boy there these thing would be on the bottom of the food chain. Worse we don't even know the full extent of what might be living at the bottom." - Brandhle a seasoned adventure living in the Ever deep tavern

The Everdeep or as people like to call it "hole into hell"
